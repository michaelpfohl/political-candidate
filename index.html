                <p class="about--content"><strong>About Jim:</strong> Congressman Jim Cooper was born and raised in Shelbyville, Tennessee. He is the son of former governor Prentice Cooper and his wife Hortense. His paternal grandfather, William Prentice Cooper, served as the mayor of Shelbyville and Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives. He earned his B.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1976, his M.A. from Oxford University in 1977 and his J.D. from Harvard University in 1980. Cooper worked as an attorney and adjunct professor at Vanderbilt University before entering public service. He and Martha, his wife of thirty-three years, live in Nashville and have three children. A New York Times columnist called him "the House's conscience, a lonely voice for civility in this ugly era" and a "tart-tongued moderate" who "seeks bipartisanship on fiscal matters and other issues in a polarized political climate." USA Today named him one of the "Brave 38" of a "tiny band of heroes" in Congress for his work on a bipartisan budget plan. In Congress, he's known for his work on the federal budget, health care and government reform. </p>
